Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researchers h-index.

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."

Example:

Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]
Output: 3 
Explanation: [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had 
             received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively. 
             Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining 
             two with no more than 3 citations each, her h-index is 3.

class Solution {
public:
    int hIndex(vector<int>& citations) {
        sort(citations.begin(), citations.end()); 
        
        int n = citations.size();
        int count = 0,h_index=0;
        for(int i=n-1;i>=0;i--) {
            count++;
            if(citations[i] >= count)
                h_index = count;
            else
                break;
        }
        return h_index;
    }
};
